        <small>cure of prostatitis</small>
        <p>
          Prostatitis is a very chronic disease that if left untreated can
          worsen into Prostrate cancer and eventually kill the victim.
          Prostatitis forms when the prostate gland is infected by bacteria
          which is transported through the urinary tract. This causes swelling
          and if ignored, it can destroy the reproductive organ of the victim
          and worse of all death. I do not say this out of mere talk. I Dr.
          Johnson Wasnak has once being plagued by this disease. Mine was
          chronic to the point that I could not urinate freely without feeling
          terrible pains. I started noticing that my urine contained blood
          stains and sometimes it was so red. I started feeling pains in my
          groin and lower back. When this pain came I felt like I was a woman in
          labor because the pain just destabilized me. Fever and chills simply
          became the order of the day. As the pain increased so did the
          fever….it was terrible. I started feeling some level of discomfort and
          body ache but I never knew the root cause. I started seeing some
          urethral discharge. One of the most discomforting things was painful
          ejaculation after my libido had dropped drastically. Sex became a
          nightmare instead of a pleasurable experience. I couldn’t have sex
          well due to the chronic pain I felt while trying to “make out “ with
          my woman. This disease was affecting not only my health, but my
          marital life simply because I could not satisfy my wife. I visited a
          doctor and he diagnosed me of Prostatitis, a disease that behaves like
          prostate cancer but is not prostate cancer. He prescribed some
          antibiotics that took the pain away temporarily but didn’t destroy the
          disease from the roots. Within 2 months the symptoms came back with
          full force. I tried so many “over the counter” drugs but they never
          seemed to work. I even tried taking some herbal formulas but it never
          just seemed to work, some worked but the symptoms came back again
          because they failed to deal with the disease from the roots.

        <h3>
          Life Was Terrible For me Because I Had To Endure The Endless Pain And
          Grueling Symptoms While Going About My Daily Activities.
        </h3>

        <p>
          Due to the frustrating pain, I cried to my friend who lives in the
          U.S.A. I narrated my ordeal with prostatitis and how I had tried so
          many things to kill it but still the grueling pain persisted. My
          friend out of concern began consulting with professional health
          consultants for a fast and permanent solution and at last he was
          introduced to this powerful solution called ‘Prostalgene” that not
          only kills prostatitis from the roots but also kills it at the SPEED
          OF LIGHT.

          See, I have tried so many products, drugs and herbs but this
          particular solution beats all what I tried hands down. Many men have
          dealt with “prostatitis” from the roots using this solution. It has
          been endorsed by health experts as the surest remedy when it comes to
          fighting “prostatitis” permanently.
